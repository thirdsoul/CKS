Falco uses syscalls to monitor a system's activity, by:

Parsing the Linux syscalls from the kernel at runtime
Asserting the stream against a powerful rules engine
Alerting when a rule is violated


What does Falco check for?
Falco ships with a default set of rules that check the kernel for unusual behavior such as:

Privilege escalation using privileged containers
Namespace changes using tools like setns
Read/Writes to well-known directories such as /etc, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, etc
Creating symlinks
Ownership and Mode changes
Unexpected network connections or socket mutations
Spawned processes using execve
Executing shell binaries such as sh, bash, csh, zsh, etc
Executing SSH binaries such as ssh, scp, sftp, etc
Mutating Linux coreutils executables
Mutating login binaries
Mutating shadowutil or passwd executables such as shadowconfig, pwck, chpasswd, getpasswd, change, useradd, etc, and others.

Userspace program - is the CLI tool falco that you can use to interact with Falco. The userspace program handles signals, parses information from a Falco driver, and sends alerts.
Configuration - defines how Falco is run, what rules to assert, and how to perform alerts
Driver - is a software that adheres to the Falco driver specification and sends a stream of kernel events
Plugins - allow to extend the functionality of Falco by adding new event sources and new fields that can extract information from events
Falcoctl - allows to easily install rules and plugins and perform administrative tasks with Falco. It is bundled together with Falco.
